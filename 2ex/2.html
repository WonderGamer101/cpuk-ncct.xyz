Epicsuperbat: "Peppermint got a promotion, love that for her, so proud "

Mako-Chan: "She settled on Peppermint, for whatever reason"

Brush: "refreshing peppermint beverages"

Janet: "peppermint has been in multiple fanfics detailing this, i recommend reading them"

Wonder: "i have no idea why, but i guess prism thinks she can easily manipulate pep"

"...are you SURE you guys aren't fuckin with me?"

Brush: "i'll bet peppermint bribed her by offering her services in character analysis"

Wonder: "dani. we would never lie about pep."

Mako-Chan: "why would we do that to you?"

Epicsuperbat: "As a lover of peppermint I would never lie about her"

Brush: "peppermint is six times taller than god"

Mako-Chan: "It's not like we wanted it either"

Janet: "yeah we don't know much about it though, just that prism gave her time powers"

Moon: "we wouldnt fuck with you"

Wonder: "at first i thought prism's bullshit in green was peppermint's doing since prism can't lie"

Janet: "and that peppermint is peppermint is peppermint"

mums: "Just another god on the To-Kill list, right?"

"Heh.....yeah, guess so"

Epicsuperbat: "Don't kill the love of my life!"

chat: does dani know about the tragedy thing

Char might have told her about it

im not confirming or denying

Brush: "well i'm pretty sure she isn't a goddess within the dream"

Brush: ".....unless she is, since we told you about it"

Wonder: "so yeah, i dunno if pep might try to beat your ass if she sees you since she's a masochist..."

Mako-Chan: "you didn't know, so I assume your dream!Pep is normal"

Mako-Chan: "well, as normal as Peppermint can be"

Janet: "or some interdimensional time nonsense is happening"

Ghost: "normal isn't Peppermint"

Epicsuperbat: “If you end up against pep please don’t hurt her too much”

"So maybe she isn't real? I'm just trying to figure it out before anything happens.....I mean we've determined that Prism's real in here....that is if you guys are tellin' me the truth about Prism messing with things"

Janet: "maybe this is the past"

Mako-Chan: "Why would we lie about White Women?"

mums: "It might help if the 'Crimson' is real in here, that would tell us its All gods, and not just Prism"

Brush: "yeah i'd be surprised if pep is real here"

Ghost: "very"

Wonder: "i wouldn't. prism's been up to some fuckshit, so she might've taught pep about dream shit"

Wonder: "maybe"

J0rt: "'real' meaning, they're also experiencing this dream and aren't just part of the dream?"

Janet: "maybe you could ask peppermint? she should know"

Mako-Chan: "Chuck a car battery at Pep"

"Oh yeah. Crimson. I feel like he might not be real, y'know, since he has a corporeal form and all."

Brush: "!givepepacarbatterytothehead"

Epicsuperbat: “What if this is everyone’s dreams and not just yours?”

Wonder: "...yeah, maybe try talking to her and see what happens."

Janet: "so does bling bling boy"

Janet: "i see your point"

Aubz: "Yeah. Crimson is uhhhh."

Raven: "Peppermint being a masochist makes her a perfect 'partner' for Prism's fuckshit, bc she's happy to be used"

Wonder: "please rephrase"

Epicsuperbat: “!givepepabigkisstothehead”

mums: "I feel like it Could be Crimson though since... Nagito is here."

J0rt: "Dani, do you know what Crimson's up to right now, actually? In real life, I mean?"

Mako-Chan: "Apperantly whoever wins the tourney experiences this dream too, so..."

Brush: "maybe everyone's real. just in varying states of lucidity. that's scary."

"I assume being dead, but if I know that bastard, he's probably found someone to hide in. Considering the concerns I've heard from Iggy, I'm gonna GUESS it's Larry"

Brush: "correct!"

Mako-Chan: "yep"

J0rt: "yep!"

Wonder: "congrats"

Ghost: "you win!"

Mako-Chan: "we call him Limbo"

mums: "Ding ding ding!"

Raven: "Got it in one, kudos"

Brush: ":tada:"

Janet: "i once called him clarry"

Janet: "good times"

mums: "Clarence..."

"Of course I'm correct. So I guess does that make Larry fake too, or.......?"

Epicsuperbat: “Yeah, hopefully he let him spend Valentine’s Day with J0hn”

J0rt: "No idea!"

Brush: "who even knows!"

mums: "For now, assume everyone but You and prism arent real"

Janet: "we're as confused as you"

mums: "And go from there"

Ghost: "i dunno"

Mako-Chan: "If not we simply kill Crim For Real This Time"

Raven: "And Quad! Quad should be real"

ROUND 3!!!!!!!

Janet: "but also there's more of us, we contain multitudes of bewildermint"

Brush: "round 3 BABEY"

Raven: "Actually wait does he even dream"

Mako-Chan: "Oh yeah, pass us to Quad!"

"Oh yeah! I haven't seen him around, so I dunno where he's at..."

Janet: !givequadanelson

Epicsuperbat: “Maybe he’s beating up prism again”

Raven: "He might need to be 'woken up' to lucidity like we did with you"

Mako-Chan: "Quad is the last fight in this part of the bracket"

mums: "Dani, how about getting a nice glass of Dream lemonade after this match?"

Brush: "quad is so far away...."

Mako-Chan: "Might be a while until we see him"

"Either way, it's a long tournament. We got time to find him, right?"

Brush: "quench your thirst with Lemon Aid Lemonaid!"

Janet: "i wonder what would happen if quad shot lasers at prism"

Wonder: "onwards"

Janet: "would they refract"

mums: "sip sip sip sip"

mums: "pour some lemonade on nelson"

Ghost: "anyone want some snacks"

Janet: "we're thirsty in here"

"Is...that how this works?"

Janet: "hopefully"

mums: "wont know until we try"

Mako-Chan: "Wait Bing talked to us. Is Bing real?"

Wonder: "...oh, shit, that's a good point"

Brush: "sipsipsipsipsipsip"

mums: "oh did you hear cupid say sepiroth had a crush on his mom"

Prince: "sipsipsipsipsip"

Epicsuperbat: “I wish Bing was real”

J0rt: "Ooh, if that means Bing is real, you could try letting us talk to other people!"

Brush: "bing real bing real"

Janet: "maybe we can make bing real with the power of friendship"

Janet: "bing real bing real"

"Well I'm not wastin any lemonade on y'all. And yeah, that's a good point. I didn't really think about that....maybe he is. Maybe he isn't. I mean, really he's just....Bing, you know?"

J0rt: "He sure is Bing"

Mako-Chan: "The real Bing was the friends we made along the way"

Brush: "bing is bing is bing. this is a fact of life"

"We can talk more later, looks like the round's over!"

Janet: "if he's not, you've got a fun story to tell the real bing!"

Epicsuperbat: “He is Bing”

Mako-Chan: "Simply commit murder"

Janet: "tell her about p+ theory"

Epicsuperbat: “Don’t kill the love of my life!”

J0rt: "fight fight fight"

Aquelon: "fighting her will make her go woo yay i got to fight someone that's cool, but also if you want to fight her it could work"

Mako-Chan: "Simply beat her so hard that she cannot participate in the tourney further"

Brush: "have you tried climbing out through the window"

Janet: "give her a big hat she can't see out of and leave while she's not looking"

"Okay guys, I just asked her if she knew anything about the time goddess thing."

"She seemed confused about it...."

Etharia: “Paint a hole in the wall you can run through but she can’t”

Wonder: "hm."

Brush: "point over her shoulder and say HEY IS THAT CRIMSON and then run away while she isn't looking"

Epicsuperbat: “Did you tell her I love her?”

Janet: "that's promising, means she's either not real or is a past version of her, im not ruling out weird time shenanigans still"

Aquelon: "aight that's probably good news"

Wonder: "so it's not real pep..."

"I'm not sure if giving her that kinda validation is the best play...."

Mako-Chan: "if anything bad happens simply bludgeon her with your axe and run away as fast as possible"

(somewhat distantly)

"Validation?"

Brush: "lock her in the bathroom or a closet or something"

Brush: "UH OH"

Janet: "give her a gold star and tell her well done"

Bubbly: "uhhhh"

Aubz: “Uhhhhh”

"Chill, I was just talkin' to myself"

Wonder: "though, this isn't the pep we know, but... prism might- hold on, validation?"

Mako-Chan: "**RUN.**"

Greenshi: "Dani? This is bad"

Raven: "THAT WAS PRISM ITALICS, RUN"

Janet: "dani this might be good"

Bubbly: "there wasnt a smile tho"

The italics are meant to be that its far away from the "mic"

Wonder: "talk to him after the match"

Wybie: “I mean he SHOULD be”

Mako-Chan: "Pass him the Nelson after the set"

Brush: "he should be but he's said all of One Sentence"

"Well if it is, he's losing to BBB so far"

Wybie: “oh god???”

J0rt: "fear!!!"

mums: "Please dont  let us fall into her hands..."

Epicsuperbat: “Aww, I miss her already”

Janet: "find a rock to give to peppermint as bait"

Brush: "we need to deal psychic damage onto pep"

"That's true, we have quite a bit of undead fighters, huh..... like isn't My Grunk a zombie?"

Wonder: "i'll keep asking if she's sneezed in her life"

mums: "The Grunk himself is technically a Zombie Too"

Janet: "also if quad's real, we can make him realise this is a dream"

Bubbly: "dont get us started"

Raven: "Oh god don't get them started on My Grunk" /lh

Mako-Chan: "Our Grunk :relieved:"

Brush: "i miss my grunk :("

"Why wouldn't she have sneezed?"

Janet: "dr order's creations don't sneeze"

Brush: "oh bc dr order made her"

Mako-Chan: "Also a can of worms"

Epicsuperbat: “Order”

Brush: "this is definitely a true fact"

"Okay first off"

Mako-Chan: "might be Order, this is still a theory"

Brush: "we've got conspiracy boards to prove it"

Janet: "the theory is she's a creation of dr order and some of us have been obsessing over this for months"

"Order made her creations so they don't sneeze? Lol what a freak"

Raven: "Oh boy"

Greenshi: "You wouldnt happen to have any pepper, would you? Perhaps a comically large feather?"

Brush: "ikr??"

mums: "Well if everyone gets to do it, I get to too. Hey do you know if Cobalts got any kids?"

Brush: "is she allergic to feathers? get her to fight an angel."

Raven: "GOD--"

"And what makes you guys think Peppermint was made by Order?"

Janet: "it'd be funny"

Bubbly: "it would be funny"

Brush: "it would be SO funny"

Wybie: “it WOULD be funny you guys are so right”

Epicsuperbat: “Funny”

Greenshi: "Imagine"

Wonder: "well. she hasn't sneezed yet, i think she has white highlights in her hair, she's green, she sucks at fighting"

Aubz: “That’s not even the best theory. Yknow The Guy? What if I told you he was J0hn’s long lost twin brother-“

Wonder: "like most of order's clones"

chirp: "listen im gonna be real with ya its like a rite of passage in here to get overly attached to an absurd theory"

Brush: "she sucks so bad imagine making a clone of the best fighter and she Sucks"

Epicsuperbat: “Especially with her goddess status”

"Cobalt having kids? Sure hope he doesn't, otherwise distributing our match would qualify as a form of emotional child abuse."

Janet: "dr order's forgotten creation being a crimson fangirl who goes 0-2 twice and becomes goddess of time"

Janet: "hilarious"

mums: "Good Lird"

Raven: "You've gotta remember, in our dimension y'all are fictional characters we coo and laugh over so of course there's gonna be silly theories. Also LMAOOOO sick burn"

Epicsuperbat: “Also how many Sephiroths are there?”

"Oh, so you're like a tightly packed little nelson full of peppermints?"

Epicsuperbat: “Has VCT ever talked about a Sephiroth?”

"But....hopefully less deranged?"

Aubz: “…When you put it like that,”

Janet: "did you know therapuppy isn't just a therapist"

Brush: "barely less deranged"

Wonder: "okay, _first of all_, we respect boundaries"

Janet: "she's also a puppy"

Raven: "I mean none of us are neurotypical but yes"

Brush: "!givechartreuseacarbatterytodroponprism"

Janet: "!givenelsonpizza"

"Dani told me that she couldn't really explain what was being talked about I thought she was simply being brash...."

Natalya: "anyway prisim is doing weird reality things"

Epicsuperbat: “Peppermint has your old job now”

Janet: "opinions on nutella?"

Brush: "do you like sour gummies"

"Doing strange things to reality DOES seem to be considered Prism's modus operandi, yes."

Natalya: "oh we should tell you this is a dream?"

Janet: !givechartreuseahat

Brush: "!givechartreuseahat"

Epicsuperbat: “Is prism around? You should slap her, for science!”

"A.....dream? Oh....I suppose she's doing this as well then."

Brush: "chartreuse real??"

Moon: "kill prism."

Janet: "this is a dream tournament controlled by prism and dreamed by multiple people"

Insider2000: "How is Folk?"

"Okay...so now that I have proper context, I should probably explain what is going on..."

Prince: "Chartreuse..."

Prince: "Real."

Janet: "prism won't let discord jack slap her"

Epicsuperbat: “Kill Prism and tell peppermint I love her”

Garf: "This is a certified Chartreuse moment"

We have a report from the field!!!!

Janet: "bing is nice"

Epicsuperbat: “Is Folk ok?”

"...Oh God, let me check my phone........78 messages from Team Magma??? groan this wasn't an ENDORSEMENT!"

Janet: "how's your nephew doing"

Epicsuperbat: “NO SEACHU”

SEACHU has been eliminated from the non-canon curiosity bracket

Eliminated by BREAKFAST and SQUID JENNY

Janet: "15"

"Oh....I assume the results just came in....."

J0rt: "Jenny won!"

Brush: "seachu down...."

Brush: "good for jenny tho!"

"Nevertheless, like I was saying, I should probably let you all know what is going on here..."

Epicsuperbat: “Kill Prism”

Janet: "we love jenny but also we love seachu!"

Brush: "oh god is she gonna get interrupted again"

Janet: "we are very ambivalent rn, in the 'mixed feelings' sense"

Epicsuperbat: “Also tell peppermint I lover her and that she’s doing a good job as goddess of time”

"You won't like hearing this, but also, it might be alright? I sincerely hope my wording does not come across as confusing, but I am not real..."

Janet: "epicsuperbat really likes peppermint as you can tell"

"Granted....you already knew that"

Brush: "you sure aren't!"

Janet: "we did indeed"

Wybie: “nooo…. chartreuse not real :(“

Aubz: “How not real are we talkin here?”

Brush: "chartreuse fake :pensive:"

Epicsuperbat: “I really love peppermint”

Janet: "normal levels or dream levels?"

Wonder: "yeah, 'not real' has like 3 different levels here"

Insider2000: "Eh. Real is overrated."

"However, whether or not I am the same Chartreuse that you know.....that is both unclear to the point that I am uncertain, but overall irrelevant."

Janet: "oh superposition of levels cool"

"I have no memory of going to sleep myself, but there is nothing stopping me from waking up in a cold sweat from this"

Aubz: “So you ARE still chartreuse though, right?”

Epicsuperbat: “Does anyone ever remember actually going to sleep”

"Prism knows of us in the same way that you all know of us. Sometimes in different points in time and in different states. And the reason that she has dominion over dreams is because of the sheer malleability of reality in this space"

Janet: "a fake chartreuse is a charlatreuse"

Insider2000: "That definitely explains why certain people are alive."

Aubz: “Interesting…. That explains a lot about her abilities, and why she can’t do stuff to us.”

Epicsuperbat: “We can still kill her tho right?”

Wonder: "so, does this make dreams a kind of narrative or narratives a type of dream?"

"I AM Chartruese, yes. Whether I am simply a projection of what you and Prism know to be Chartreuse or if I am asleep in my bed assisting with this dream......I do not know. Regardless, all participants will forget this tournament ever happened soon after awakening. It's unfortunate. However, I'm sure those of you....familiar....with Prism's antics will understand why this is the case."

Aubz: “Makes sense. We’ll remember though, if that’s any condolence.”

Epicsuperbat: “Can we still kill her?”

Aubz: “We remember a lot.”

Janet: "so prism splits and filters realities and their interpretations like light through a glass prism, and the less more mixed up the 'light' is the more ways she can split it?"

Janet: "if we remember, can we tell awake you via jack?"

"Can we kill her? Like I said, reality is quite....malleable here....so I suppose that _it would be absolutely impossible regardless of the malleability of reality. Giving up on such an effort is the wisest decision, since the goal of this endeavor is simply to pass the time and entertain :)_"

Brush: "PRISM"

Wonder: "alright, guess that's a no"

Brush: "GET HER ASS"

Epicsuperbat: “DIE PRISM! LEAVE HER ALONE!”

Greenshi: "Shes doing it again"

Natalya: "Prism moment. So no"

mums: "Can you just chill prism. for a half a second."

"....hmm....mortality has made it far more difficult to even detect it."

Garf: "Wow imagine being Prism (Prism is synonymous with the word cringe)"

mums: "Like. go drink some mimosas. go on a yacht. just chill out girl."

Epicsuperbat: “Ask peppermint maybe she can help kill prism”

Janet: "everything after 'i suppose that' was prism"

Greenshi: "That implies she does this to yall regularly. Trucy I'm sorry"

Epicsuperbat: “I wanna kill her even more now”

mums: "You know, we haven't seen cobalt in a dream yet. I wonder if he's been tired out from using his balance powers..."

" Ask Peppermint? Hmmmm.......I suppose that COULD work. After all, if she is a goddess now, then she should be able to better detect Prism's influence. Would you like me to deliver you to her? :) "

Janet: "suit for sleeping in"

J0rt: "DO NOT."

Wonder: "don't"

Janet: "all of that was prism"

mums: "GIRL GO TO MIAMI FLORIDA AND LEAVE US ALONE"

Brush: "NOPES"

Wonder: "DANI HELP"

Greenshi: "God,"

Moon: "GO GET MAIMED BITE KILL MIAIM"

"How.....how much of that........."

Bubbly: "DONT LET US GO"

Insider2000: "I'm sure Peppermint will be fine around you."

J0rt: "KEEP US AWAY FROM PEPPERMINT PLEASE"

Epicsuperbat: “DELIVER ME TO PEPPERMINT PLEASE”

mums: "Prism you seem like a Disney park mom who keeps her kids on leashes and makes them stand in line for photos of characters theyre scared of"

Janet: "every word"

"Oh god....."

Greenshi: "One womans thirst cannot ruin this whole mission. It Must not"

J0rt: "Chartreuse I'm so sorry :("

Wonder: "you can hug the nelson if it makes you feel better"

"Well, I've told you my piece for now. Perhaps we can meet again in the near future."

Brush: ":wave:"

Natalya: "yeah"

"I hope that this is useful moving forward"

mums: "We will miss you."

Garf: "Ice cold take.  Prism is so fucking cringe"

Epicsuperbat: “I WILL LET PRISM LIVE FOR A SINGLE KISS FROM PEPPERMINT”

Janet: "best of luck chartreuse, thank you"

J0rt: "Bye Chartreuse!"

[Subzero Amalgam vs Peppermint]

chat: ........peppermint would fit in with us, wouldn't she.

chat: yeah but she's... talking to them in person.

Yeah it would be weird if you guys could directly talk to these guys huh

chat: it would be!

Aubz: “Hi”

Bubbly: "hiiiii dani"

Brush: "HI!"

Greenshi: "Oh hey"

mums: "Greetings!"

Janet: "hi we're weird"

Wonder: "hey, so this is a lot more fucked up than we thought"

Aubz: “Not sure who we’re talking to but hi :)”

Brush: "we really are a bunch of peppermints huh"

"Oh hey sorry, just taking Nelson back from Chartreuse.....what was up with that conversation?"

mums: "Hmmm complicated"

J0rt: "Prism being awful"

Greenshi: "Weve been reflecting. Were choosing to ignore what we've learned."

Wonder: "prism messed with the ciblings' dreams for their whole lives"

Janet: "chartreuse knew what was up but probably isn't real, prism has done this before"

Epicsuperbat: “Have you told peppermint I love her yet”

Aquelon: "yeah if i met peppermint i would mention LVE to her and then she'd be like Yeah I'm Cool With That Actually I'm into That and then i'd kill her on the spot"

"Holy shit."

Wonder: "at least i think that's what's implied"

Janet: "a lot before"

Wonder: "she also got her dialogue rewritten by prism, so"

Prince: "I haven't been paying attention but I know Prism sucks."

Janet: "also i realised you might not know, this is the second dream tournament we're seeing you in"

"That.....explains a lot actually"

chirp: "Discussing the nature of reality with an ex-goddess, yknow the vibes"

mums: "No wonder they're so messed up."

Janet: "when you woke up and saw that paper? you woke up from the last one"

Natalya: "Prisim was controlling what chartreuse was saying a lot"

"The second? I mean it makes sense because the paper said something about going at it again, but....I don't remember anything about that"

Aubz: “You won!”

Janet: "prism had less obvious influence until the end of the last one"

Aubz: “Although that’s probably not surprising at all in the slightest”

Brush: "you lost. barely. i guess."

Greenshi: "Either you or dadendorf won"

"Yeah I was asking if anything unsurprising happened"

Aubz: “Uhh… there was this guy named Jerry?”

"Oh wait I lost? But the other voice just said......Prism had something to do with it I'm guessing?"

mums: "Ah yes, Saturdays were made for Dads!"

Wonder: "she did"

Greenshi: "Ended before we saw"

Epicsuperbat: “Yeah, can we kill her now?”

Janet: "prism did actual rainbow text when she noticed the dream, it was intense and we're not sure exactly what she changed"

Brush: "prism didn't let us see the result"

chirp: "the results were. contested to say the least"

mums: "Dadondorf is a formidable opponent either way"

Aquelon: "it was a very close match"

"Kill her? I'd love to, but apparently every time I try she rewrites reality and shit"

Janet: "give dadondorf a high five or something imo, he earned it"

ROUND THREE!!!

mums: "It is likely you will face him once more during this tourney."

Bubbly: PEP PUTTING UP A FIGHT

Epicsuperbat: “Isn’t reality Crimsons domain? Maybe he can do it?”

Aquelon: "dimensions and reality are different i think"

Epicsuperbat: “WOO LETS GO PEPPERMINT”

Aquelon: "overlap but different"

Aquelon: "LET'S GO SUBZERO"

Brush: "FREEZE HER ASS"

mums: "Thats right! While peppermint is distracted, Dani! The closet with crimson in it!"

Prince: "LET'S GO SUBZERO"

Janet: "also prism totally took over what chartreuse was telling us, she didn't want us knowing anything, and it was very messed up"

Wonder: "OH SHIT, YEAH"

mums: "We can interrogate him! Get some info"

Prince: "THE CRIMBO CLOSET"

"As far as I know Crimson's more about the different dimensions and universes. Reality is a whole other ballgame."

Wonder: "GO TO THE CLOSET"

Greenshi: "Subzero will achieve relevance through violence"

Janet: "yeah go find crimson!!!"

Prince: "get him out of the closet"

Janet: "free him"

Epicsuperbat: “Damn”

Wonder: "prince, we already know he's gay /j"

Brush: "he's gay (good for him)"

Prince: "inclusivity win."

Greenshi: "I want to speak directly into crimsons mind."

chirp: "Crimson's still probably a good perspective to get on this. and hey, this is just a dream so it shouldnt be too much of a Problem to talk to him"

Janet: "he may be better able to resist the prisming than chartreuse, since he's still a god"

mums: "I want to punch him for Val but we should question him first."

"I asked Chartreuse and she said 'what you guys are seeing is reality. tekken vs cpuk is universes and dimensions'. No idea what the hell that means"

Epicsuperbat: “Check if Crimsons ok”

Brush: "oh yeah that makes sense"

Natalya: "ah got it"

Janet: "okay so it's medium vs narrative that makes sense"

Insider2000: "So what we're saying is, we could go get Yoshimitsu's autograph at any time?" /j

chirp: "figured as much"

mums: "kazuya real?"

"I do like the idea of asking Crimson about this. Although I should probably go real damn fast since it looks like the sets almost over. They each have two stocks"

Aubz: “Interesting…”

Raven: "Ok that checks. Cobalt wad able to limit her before, but I doubt he can do anything unside the dream"

mums: "SPRINT!"

"Be back soon!"

"Yeah of course Funbox is okay. The hell kinda question is that?"

Wonder: "how do we stop prism from rewriting shit?"

Brush: "Good."

Raven: "Hello from the 'all of you are fictional' dimension!"

Epicsuperbat: “Good”

mums: "Secondly, what do you know about beating Prism?"

Janet: "prism totally took over chartreuse's dialogue earlier btw it was messed up"

Greenshi: "Did you know gaming: you are dreaming and Prisms fucking with shit?"

"Oh, I'M a bastard???"

"Shhh! Keep it down!"

Wonder: "yes."

Aubz: “Yeah. But like /pos.”

mums: "Oh btw, where are we?"

Janet: "we'll tell you when prism messes with stuff, we can tell"

Brush: "bastard (affectionate)"

chirp: "hi crimson. We're in one of your fucked up babysitters trippy dream zones."

Wonder: "crimson, it's _literally_ your calling, we do not have time for this"

Aubz: “That does NOT stand for piece of shit. Well. It could.”

Insider2000: "Peppermint is probably on her way. Keep quiet. Unless you WANT her to find you."

Natalya: "Not as much as prisim but you did try to destroy a universe"

Prince: "Hi Crimson!"

J0rt: "I'm still a little upset about the Larry situation"

"Vents. Dani suggested it last second. It's............very VERY cramped....but it's getting the job done"

Janet: "dani and quad are real"

Wonder: "prism nonsense, peppermint's the new goddess of time but that version of her isn't in this dream yet"

Brush: "sleepytimes"

Greenshi: "Prisms doing her whole shtick and its fucking everything up"

Raven: "Prism is godmodding reality and won't let us commit Violence"

Natalya: "Prism dream, shes editing reamity, uh. We can talk to you here"

Aquelon: "prism won't let us slap her or hit her with a car battery, also"

Epicsuperbat: “I wanna kiss peppermint “

Aquelon: "ALSO WHAT SHE DID TO PRISMATIC SHADOW IS MEGA FUCKED UP, ACTUALLY,"

mums: "You gotta be careful, okay? As much of a grudge many of us have, I'd very much hate to see her do... That, to you again."

Janet: "chartreuse knew what was up and explained why prism's so powerful, but then got godmoded and had to leave for her own wellbeing"

Aquelon: "yeah"

"Oh yeah, Prism's almost certainly doing dream bullshit. Did you just catch onto that one? You want a damn medal?"

"Dude, chill out, they're catching you up to speed"

"Oh right chillin's easy when you're next to someone who's 2-0 for beating the shit out of you when in close proximity!!!"

Insider2000: "Crimson, it's either Dani or Peppermint."

Greenshi: "Crimbo. Shut your fuck."

Brush: "i don't think the vents give enough room for her to beat the crap out of you!"

Raven: "Valid, Dani is intimidating (in a hot way)"

Brush: "spacing and all that"

Janet: "also prism's controlling discord jack outside the dream to stop him slapping her awake :c"

mums: "Crimson, how can we stop Prism? Either in here, or the waking world?"

"Wanna make it 3-0, redhead?"

Brush: "just stay vented and no one will ever find you :)"

Janet: "btw bing is nice c:"

Aquelon: "let me put this into perspective: prismatic shadow's current situation is approximately as fucked up as CBT DEMON's situation. so. yikes."

".....ahem ....anyway, yeah good to see you guys are in the know here. What do you want me to do about it? If I knew how to beat Prism, dontcha think I would have my corporeal form in the real world?"

Epicsuperbat: “What are your feelings towards Crimsonaut?”

J0rt: "So you're still stuck possessing Larry huh?"

Janet: "maybe beating prism requires us to work together?"

Raven: "Do you know what the source of her powers is? How to weaken her?"

mums: "Have you ever attempted it with the help and knowledge of your ciblings though?"

"Crimsonaut? Miss the guy. Hope he's havin' a good day or whatever"

Brush: "wanted to say hi!"

Natalya: "Idk we figured it wouldnt hurt to talk to you. I guess we didnt think that far ahead"

Janet: "crimsonaut made someone cry today"

Aquelon: "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"

Janet: "in the dream"

Aquelon: "he fought korioni"

Insider2000: "He made Korioni cry."

Greenshi: "Crimson. Odd question. Does the name Powerfrog ring any bells? Or, perhaps, The Red Shadow? Asking for a friend."

Epicsuperbat: “You should talk to Naut”

"How the hell should I know how to beat Prism? Like, yeah obviously she's impossible to defeat :)  So I Nooooooooononononono I don't think so ya chromatic fuck"

Aquelon: "you should probably also apologize to naut for the cbt demon thing"

mums: "Ah, interesting."

Brush: "YEAHHHHHHHHHHH HE KNOWS"

Janet: "prism can't lie, but is that lieing about before or after her reality shifts?"

mums: "You were able to fight her off, unlike Chartreuse."

Raven: "Ah! You can sense it!!! That's good, we need that!!!"

Greenshi: "Ah. Inch resting."

chirp: "Chartreuse cant tell when shes doing it anymore. But you can."

Aquelon: "she can't lie but maybe that has no impact on making other people lie"

mums: "Chartreuse is... at her mercy."

"I appreciate nostalgia trip Prism, but you don't think I'm not able to fight against you a bit better now?"

Raven: "And Peppermint is actively working with her"

Epicsuperbat: “Can you Kill Prism in the dream? Or slap her, for science?”

Janet: "oh btw quad beat prism unconscious outside the dream it was great"

mums: "Hey man. Proud of you."

"And no shit Chartreuse is vulnerable. She gave up her godhood....dumbass."

Greenshi: "Oh yeah! Peppermints the new goddess of time! Have f u n !"

Insider2000: "Where is Cobalt?"

Wonder: "look, dickhead, either you stop with the smarm or we just shut up"

Epicsuperbat: “If you run into peppermint tell her I love her”

Janet: "dream peppermint isn't timey though"

mums: "Cobalt was able to stop Prism from using her spirit. I think thats valuable information."

"Cobalt? I dunno. Not here, from the looks of it"

"Oh yeah, that was cuz of his balance crap, right?"

Brush: "yea"

Insider2000: "Cobalt might be the key. With him, he may be able to tip the scales in our favor."

mums: "Yup! What tricks do you think you have up your sleeves?"

Aquelon: "yeah, sic-ing her on the folks who can actually put up w her bullshit might be a smart move actually, keep that one in your back pocket"

Raven: "Prism must've left him out of the dream bc she knows he can limit her power"

Janet: "yeah, and i bet you are equally dangerous to her"

Janet: "just gotta work out in what way"

"I've got a couple ideas up my sleeve. Nothing I can show off here, though. Hell, even bringing up I HAVE and idea's pretty dangerous."

mums: "Someone tuck cobalt in and sing him a lullaby so he can join us... I miss him..."

Janet: "yeah that's fair"

Brush: "do what you gotta do! it'll be funny!"

Aubz: “Good to know!”

Insider2000: "Have you considered... convincing Peppermint to join against Prism?"

mums: "Thats a good point"

Greenshi: "Have fun with the crimes"

Aquelon: "hmmm... dimensions and treachery.  dimensions... are cool. that's all i've got.  could probably do some awesome shit to her mind control to get it to be worked against although the emotional ramifications on funny froggy would still be dire."

Epicsuperbat: “Have you considered giving Peppermint your god powers?”

"After all, she can see everything :) Even outside of Nelson :) . You know, that's actually what I was gonna say. No need to make it all spookier with your little smileys, ya girl scout"

mums: "Hey, do you have any updates on Spectrums status? Are... they stable?"

ROUND 3!!!

Greenshi: ".......don't like that"

Brush: "hey prism :) look at me :) _car battery_"

Janet: "your enemy-of-my-enemies against prism include dani, quad, and cobalt, btw"

Aquelon: "gun"

Brush: "bing doing well against hamburger!"

Greenshi: Prism, sweetie, can you hear this?

Garf:

Garf: everyone @ prism

"Of course I can :) I.....don't know what that was in response to....."

Aubz: “HM.”

Brush: "yeah she can hear us. don't like that!"

mums: "Hey, Crimson, while I get the chance? For everything you put Val through, I hope one day he beats you into the dirt so low they have to excavate you from the earth."

Aquelon: "ok so she can confirmably see non-nelsoned text"

Bubbly: Uh oh. Hm.

Garf: Hey Prism quick fun fact

Janet: "that was in response to a non-nelsoned message"

Epicsuperbat: Hey Prism! Die!

Garf: You suck and we hate you as a person

Aquelon: "as in something we weren't saying into the hedgehog"

Aubz: Hey prism, I see a car battery in your future

Wonder: hm.

Janet: "everyone is now insulting her in non-nelsoned messages, i think you might appreciate that"

Aquelon: hey prism you're making this harder for the transcripts

Janet: prism you're a meanie >:c

Natalya: 100% chance she does not care

Aquelon: still gonna give her shit for it tho

mums: "Also I know I just wished immense pain on you, but do you like hedgehogs?"

"Okay, so you mentioned the whole Peppermint God thing. Yeah, I heard about that. I dunno what the gameplan is for that, but I'm still thinkin, alright?"

Aubz: “Take your time”

Epicsuperbat: “Send me to peppermint and I’ll kiss her”

Also I miiiiiiight retcon the Prism seeing non-nelsoned text? Sorry for the confusion

Aquelon: "oh also while we're here. uh.  let cbt demon get unpossessed please please please i've never asked for anything ever in my life ever in my life ever."

And we have a report from the field!!!

Janet: "she won't know her limits, easy to trick her into overdoing timey things in a pinch"

"Crimson, she's coming by!"

chat: i diagnose ryan with Must Tell Story disease

Yeah....thats pretty much it

Like it started as a form of, like, withdrawal almost. I have been trying to distance myself from my online life since I thought I based far too much of my happiness on my public persona. But like...performing and storytelling is what I do, you know? I can't just stop that.

chat: Yeah there's nothing wrong with just. wanting to make things and tell stories!

Yeah....honestly, part of what I was hoping for when I went offline was the idea of doing what I do but caring far less about how it did for a broad audience, and more for what it did to people who I knew cared

We have a report from the field!

"Thank you for sharing your hope with me! I hope you know that you don't have to report anything, Shadow. Crimson will get what's coming to him in time. Now drift back to sleep, and remember that Prism loves you :) "

Bubbly: "OH GOD."

Greenshi: "Frog pain."

Epicsuperbat: “Do you know where Blasp came from?”

Brush: "just like five'd nights at fred"

"I THINK she knows.....but no way to be sure.....god why the hell does she love me so much? Did I corrupt her on accident?"

"I dunno, ask that Ryan guy"

Greenshi: "Frog. Or hedgehog, both is fibe"

"He seems to know him"

chat: HEY RYAN IS SHADOW THE HEDGEHOG REAL

We have to do that thing where we determine what "real" means

chat: does shadow exist in cpuk canon

I dunno, I'm guessing he was joking about the dubs?

Brush: "real in the dubs i guess"

mums: "Anyways, is Dani still up there with you?"

Epicsuperbat: “Hey have you seen Big the cat lately? Is he ok?”

Janet: "anyway yeah i think peppermint used the thought of you as a coping mechanism so now she's frantically clinging onto everything about you she can while not actually doing anything for what she was coping with"

"Yeah, we're just kinda chillin. We've actually been chatting it up a bit. Ya really learn about someone when you're smooshed in a vent with em, you know?"

Aquelon: "anyway we were referring to the prismatic shadow.  pros: we can maybe help this frog know the truth, and maybe if we're lucky let him break free. cons: might traumatize him."

Janet: "she's in a bad place and got parasocial with a god"

Brush: "vent buddies"

mums: "hey thats nice"

J0rt: "Tell Dani we say hi"

Greenshi: "They're bonding! : D"

mums: "Dani honey, how are you holding up?"

Brush: "i don't think prismatic shadow still exists in the dream"

Brush: "he might've woken up"

Aquelon: "other pros: this isn;t canon so he won't remember it.  other cons: also that."

Janet: "prismatic shadow is still asleep, but maybe dreamlessly, according to nagito as puppetted by prism"

"Oh yeah, well if someone wakes up, they're replaced with a duplicate that's indistinguishable from the real thing"

Aquelon: "fucked up"

Brush: "freaky"

Wonder: "is that how that works????"

Bubbly: "oh geez"

Epicsuperbat: “Bad”

Greenshi: "Ah."

"Hell everyone here's either a dreamer or just a copy made up of memories"

J0rt: "WHAT?"

mums: "Unsettling! but makes sense."

Aquelon: "true"

Wonder: "so we can't trust anyone?"

Bubbly: "scary scary scary"

"Worst part is the copies don't know they're copies. Hell, I could be a copy and I wouldn't know it"

Janet: "wait so there might be a discord jack copy with his powers around here?"

Greenshi: "Do you know who the dreamers are?"

Brush: "i don't think jack's in the tournament"

Brush: "then again, he's usually in the audience"

Epicsuperbat: “So some of the others could be real”

Insider2000: "Have you ever heard of Theseus' Ship?" /hj

"As for trust? It's not like a hivemind situation where Prism hears us through the copies. Like...she can hear us anyway"

ROUND THREE!!!

Brush: "yeah she already knows what we're up to"

Epicsuperbat: “Hey Prism! Let us slap you!”

Aquelon: "aight so basically it doesn't impact anything since either way they're not gonna remember when they wake up"

Epicsuperbat: “Also. Go Blasp!”

Janet: "oh, if you can work out how to communicate with non-nelsoned text, like how you read twitch chat that one time, that could be a safe communication channel"

"If there's text that exists within this quote unquote story whispering  (breakin the news to Dani's gonna cause more trouble than its worth), then Prism can see it"

Aquelon: "hey prism car battery"

Prince: "CAR BATTERY!"

Wonder: "well she better get a good look at these 🖕 🖕"

Janet: "can prism read fanfics"

"Victorious wasn't even that good of a show :) Wow, and I thought I was antagonistic"

Greenshi: "If Prism can read fic then I'm Fucked"

Wonder: "yeah, we know"

Insider2000: "I mean, she's right."

Brush: "of course not. it sucks. there's a whole thirteen hours of video explaining this"

Garf: "best part of Victorious right here"

Epicsuperbat: “If I write a story where I beat up prism is it canon?”

Aquelon: "and that's why car battery!"

mums: "Crimson, whats your favorite tv show?"

Wonder: "wow, prism sucks at assuming things about people, holy shit"

Aquelon: "SO TRUE"

Garf: "yeah no Prism we know Victorious sucks lmao"

Wonder: "she can see everything we type and she can't even put 2 and 2 together"

"Listen, I might be trapped in a vent with one of my sworn enemies, but this is one of the best moments of my life"

Insider2000: "Awwww. Tender moment! Group hug!"

"Oh.....do you really think this is a good idea? :)"

mums: "Hug the nelson Crimson, do it"

Epicsuperbat: “Tell Dani we said hi”

Janet: "hug the nelson"

Brush: ":hugging: "

Janet: "go away prism"

Greenshi: "Prism, let us have our moment."

J0rt: "think WHAT is a good idea? insulting you to your face?"

Janet: "this is hugtime"

mums: "Prism, you could get hugs if you weren't cold and cruel."

Epicsuperbat: “Piss off prism!”

Garf: "Yeah no Crimson you need to know we show Prism NO mercy and are pretty much relentless on clowning on her"

J0rt: "or uh. to your. text?"

Greenshi: "Anyway crimson, glad your having a good time"

Aquelon: "bullying prism?  girl, we're at a stalemate.  neither of us can hurt the other except for emotionally.  and like, she already pulled out the emotionally, turnabout is fair play."

chirp: "Glad you're enjoying the catharsis of our relentless untouchable clowning on prism, red guy"

"Oh yeah for real. I'm really glad that you're firing back and giving her a bit of a taste of her own HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEY!!!!!!!!!!!! :) "

Janet: "there is nothing she can do to stop us, even if she writes out nelson we'll just keep going outside nelson"

Epicsuperbat: “Die foul wench!”

"Crimson, what the fuck are you doing????"

mums: " Hey! I'm shantae!"

Garf: "Shut the fuck up Prism we don't like you bug off"

Brush: "UH OH!"

Wonder: "uh oh"

mums: "Summon nagito and Shantae to your aid!"

Aquelon: "PRISMMMMM YOU DIDN'T LET US SLAP YOU"

chirp: "AW FUCK TOO LOUD"

Greenshi: "Well pepper my mints"

Aquelon: "FOR THE NARRATIVE CONVENTION"

Bubbly: "UH OH"

Wonder: "CRIMSON SHOVE US IN YOUR MOUTH AS A MUFFLER"

mums: "I believe the power of Shantae could beat peppermint anyday"

Janet: "did you ever got one of those fake nelsons to throw at pep"

Aquelon: "PRISM YOU ARE A FUCKING COWARD OF THE WORST VARIETY AND YOU HURT THE FUNNY FROGGY"

Greenshi: " I do not want to be in his mouth"

"It's not me, she's HEEEEYYYYYYY PEPPERMINT!!!!!! :) Oh you little SHIT! HAVE YOU CHECKED TH-  God fucking.....I gotta-"

Bubbly: "SHUT UP PRISM"

Aquelon: "WE CAN BE A DISTRACTION IF SUPER NEEDED"

END NELSON EVENT

Wonder: "to be perfectly honest, i have no idea why that's the first idea that came to mind"

Brush: "KILLING AND BITING"

Aquelon: "IT'LL SUCK BUT"

this is the reason I did this shit

The Dynamics

Like for real, this shit has so many characters. Exploring the dynamics without having to worry about A Big Overarching Plot is freeing

Also cupid a dumbass but he gettin some snipes

I have a report from the field though.

Bubbly: "ok thank god"

Epicsuperbat: “Bus”

Greenshi: "Hella"

Bubbly: "green. room???"

Epicsuperbat: “Green”

Wonder: "it's like a waiting lounge in theaters"

Greenshi: "Hey! Get out of my room!"

Wonder: "i just looked it up"

"Green room, like, a waiting lounge for fighters"

Bubbly: "ah"

Aquelon: "oh aight"

Brush: "ah yes, things that bloodsports competitors would know!"

Bubbly: "too many things with Color Associations"

Greenshi: "Ah. Malright."

Janet: "is it a green green room or a non-green green room"

"Usually when we're prepping to fight, we hang out in here. I don't know why it's empty, but I'd assume it's got something to do with the dream stuff. Most people don't even use their green rooms for anything anyway"

"Wait, is this Green Room D?"

"I don't know???"

Aquelon: "so do we have a plan for a next step?  attacking prism directly is physically impossible because she'll just uno reverse card it, cyberbullying her is fun but isn't really a direction, and if pep gets here we'll deal with that when we deal with it-- oh?"

"Ohhhhhh yeah it is baby!!!!!!!!!!!"

Greenshi: "Feels like a good place for crimson to do some crimes."

J0rt: "....how many green rooms are there actually"

"What? Why is this important, you're only giving our location away t-"

"..............."

".....is that?"

Wonder: "what is what"

Brush: "bastard momence"

"Secret cabinet? Yeah"

Aquelon: "ok if you need to throw us at them for a distraction-- ok phew"

Brush: "ooh!"

"THATS not what I mean, Crimson...."

"YES ITS THE MASHED POTATOES"

Wonder: "the fucking what"

Brush: "mashed Po Ta Toes"

Prince: "The what"

Greenshi: "Potatoes"

Prince: "The WHAT"

Bubbly: "DOES HE HAVE A STASH IN HERE"

"Secret snack, baby! Left it here a few tournaments ago"

chirp: "The Huh?"

J0rt: "oh Dani can we have some mashed potatoes???"

mums: "Trreat for crimson?"

Brush: "WHAT"

Aubz: “MASHED POTATOES??”

Prince: "WHAT"

Bubbly: "GOD"

mums: "TREAT FOR A GUY"

"OF MASHED POTATOES??????"

Epicsuperbat: “Potatoes”

Aubz: “I mean good for you”

Prince: "THERE'S PROBABLY RATS NOW."

Brush: "OLD MASHED POTATOES"

Wonder: "we need to leave"

J0rt: "I mean there have always been rats"

"HOW OLD ARE THOSE?"

mums: "EAT UP CRIMSON"

J0rt: "Like Johannsen"

mums: "WHO KNOWS WHEN YOULL GET A CHANCE OTHERWISE"

Epicsuperbat: “That can’t be edible”

Wonder: "these are dream potatoes too"

mums: "EAT IT NOW"

"IRRELEVANT!!!!!!!"

Brush: "they're how he remembers them"

Aquelon: "ok so the plan is eat potatoes"

Aquelon: "got it"

"That's HIS plan."

Epicsuperbat: “I think it’s a good plan”

Greenshi: "I see no better solution. Crimson, eat them with gusto"

J0rt: "So, they're where you left them even though you're in a dream?"

"I don't see why we can't just go out and attack Peppermint. Quit running from all this."

mums: "It would be awkward"

Brush: "they're probably gone in the real world"

"After all, it's a dream, right?"

Epicsuperbat: “I’d be sad”

J0rt: "I would fight Peppermint"

mums: "It might be bestto wait until she gets knocked out of bracket"

J0rt: "But that's me"

mums: "Then you can move freely"

chirp: "Allied with prism. dangerous."

Wonder: "prism might do something weird"

"Oh! You haven't figured it out yet, have ya?"

Brush: "dream us into a car battery then throw us"

Aquelon: "well hopefully peppermint doesn't have prism on her side"

Greenshi: "Fight peppermint, for fun and profit"

".......figured out what?"

Aquelon: "oh wait is it There's No Grudge Matches In THis One?"

"Ohohohohoho! Alright alright alrightalrightalrightalright. Let's walk through this."

mums: "Prism can I have mashed potatoes"

mums: "I've been good"

Wonder: "why are you asking prism"

mums: "Why not"

Aquelon: "tell me if any mashed potatoes appear at your location"

"Peppermint hates you. Peppermint MIGHT have God Powers.....you lose...what happens?"

"I don't lose, Crimson"

Epicsuperbat: “Bear”

Aquelon: "not unless pep CHEATS! which she COULD!"

Brush: "not against peppermint. UNLESS."

Greenshi: "*prism"

"SHUT"

Brush: "prism has been known to tamper with matches"

Wonder: "...oh."

Aquelon: "e.g. by prism-ing it up with the outcome or receiving a spirit"

chirp: "dani we regret to inform you we know about the bear"

Wonder: "i see where this is going"

"What was that?"

".........what was the question again?"

"What happens when you lose?"

"It's a dream. I wake up....ri- OW!"

"Hey, what the hell?"

"Isn't there some trick that pinching someone wakes them up?"

Aquelon: "ooooh was that the slap test?  i'm still gonna try to get the slap test on prism anyhow"

Aquelon: "it's the principle of the thing"

Wonder: "...maybe prism might interfere with pep trying to beat dani?"

Wonder: "like, she doesn't want dani to lose, so she'll rewrite it so that pep gets her ass beat instead?"

"Listen, Dani. I'm sure you've figured this out....but Prism is a monster."

Aquelon: "so she'll cheat the match and then REALLY rub it in?"

"If you think she'll let you escape from this that easily, then you've got another thing coming"

Aquelon: "in some horrible, possibly oh-fuck-remember-what-happened-to-funny-froggy esque way?"

Epicsuperbat: “I’m scared of what she’s done in the past”

J0rt: "YOU DIE IN THE DREAM YOU DIE IN REAL LIFE???"

chirp: "...oh god, is this an 'if you die in the dream you die for real' scenario if you become lucid?"

Insider2000: "You die in someone's mind, you pee your pants!"

"They're asking what happens if I die. Do I die in real life too?"

Prince: "YOU DIE IN CLONE HIGH, YOU DIE IN THE SKY"

Wonder: "well, prism wouldn't let you die, right? you're like...important to her narrative or something"

Aquelon: "prism definitely doesn't have the narrative fiat to make this impact canon, because that's the POINT is that it doesn't"

Epicsuperbat: “!giveprismaslap”

Brush: "!giveprismaslap"

Aquelon: "!giveprismaslap"

Prince: "!giveprismaslap"

" Oh, no nothing that serious!! Not at all! You probably won't like what she does while you're trapped in the dream. It's basically hell what she can put you through, but you don't die! "

Bubbly: "yikes"

Brush: "Yikes!"

"In fact, you forget right after you wake up!"

Epicsuperbat: “Wow”

Prince: "HUH."

Greenshi: ".........fuck, dude"

Prince: "Fuck, dude! Sure is."

"But, like, you always kinda feel it in the back of your mind, y'know?"

Aquelon: "right so it's just Experience Of Pain or-- oh god so it's a zone of no consequences"

Prince: "Consequences don't exist here..."

"......Jesus Christ, Crimson, is that what happened to you?"

Aquelon: "no consequences is terrifying because she can do anything and it won't impact the status quo"

Greenshi: "Oh?"

Epicsuperbat: “I’m gonna fight Prism myself”

Epicsuperbat: “Let me at her! Let me at her!”

"Hey hey.....God of Treachery. Obviously, she's had a few issues with me over the years"

Aubz: “Crimson….”

Bubbly: "oh buddy...."

Greenshi: "Prism, stop."

Brush: "hm. biting and killing and biting and killing"

Aubz: “YOU”

Wonder: "cope"

Epicsuperbat: “MMMMMMMMMMMMMJUSTICE”

Insider2000: "Good. Thriving over your misery."

Aquelon: "much better now that we finally tested 'slapping prism awake' theory"

Brush: "brat"

Greenshi: "HOWS JUSTICE TASTE?"

J0rt: "why do you want us to be held by peppermint so bad"

"Thank SPECTRUM you can't see this damn black eye......especially because for SOME reason I can't get rid of it for now...."

Aquelon: "but much worse now that i know more about the statuses of prismatic shadow and crimson:

J0rt: "...weird phrasing but you know what i mean"

Brush: "HAHA"

Bubbly: "HAH."

Aubz: “LOL”

Brush: "i am pointing and laughing"

Wonder: "_**:)**_"

Aubz: “LMAO”

Insider2000: "Rainbow lady looking a little black and blue?"

Greenshi: "Good"

Aquelon: "oh i can't see it but i have microsoft paint!"

Epicsuperbat: “POWER OF JUSTICE”

Aquelon: "...which i will utilize in the morning and not now"

Bubbly: "get got. for the second time."

Prince: "L + Ratio + No narrative significance +  Your arc got dropped + Bad at fighting + You got punched + Free Will Exists and there is Nothing You can Do About It. "

Wonder: "lol imagine misunderstanding a character so bad they break through your rewrites"

Aquelon: "also were you seriously wondering why we didn't like you at the start of all this?  and then prismatic shadow is Like That?"

Brush: "don't get us wrong. you're a fantastic villain."

"Okay, I've combed over the tournament. No idea how he even GOT there, but he did! And you know what? That's fine! Because he's gone from the bracket now! I don't see him in the dreamscape anymore. Things should be fine!"

Greenshi: "That wont stop JUSTICE"

Wonder: "...huh, yeah, that is weird"

Prince: "Bring back the frog, you rainbow-colored piece of shit."

Epicsuperbat: “YOU THINK YOU CAN PREVENT JUSTICE”

Prince: "In the name of JUSTICE!"

Wonder: "still funny that he entered your dream and punched you in the face"

"I know what happened. I know WHY it happened."

Insider2000: "Your days are still numbered, Skittles!"

J0rt: "maybe he was just taking a nice nap and you woke him up >:("

Aquelon: "well, do feel free to elaborate."

Greenshi: "God! Of! Justice! /hj"

Brush: "clearly toj is the god of justice"

Aquelon: "and if the answer is 'our desire to see you punched manifested a puncher' then... hmm, joe drift vehicular manslaughter moments anyone?"

"Either way.....this whole story's gone down QUITE the rabbit hole of stuff that won't even matter."

"But you know what? Perhaps it will."

Wonder: "still satisfying that you got punched"

Brush: "it matters to me. it matters so much"

Aubz: “Yeah”

Greenshi: "It matters to us."

Aquelon: ":pencil:"

Epicsuperbat: “It matters to us”

Aubz: “We’ll remember this!”

Prince: "I want to see Joe Drift Isekai you into the cold depths of space, but."

Epicsuperbat: “And that’s still important “

Aquelon: "like, we're not forgetting that prismatic shadow thing.  or that crimson thing."

"Wait.....wait a minute, I think I have an idea......"

chirp: "you cant just tell people what doesnt matter. People choose that for themselves."

Wonder: "is it to fuck off forever?"

"Wait...no that would just completely throw a wrench in everything....."

Bubbly: "do it, you wont"

Aquelon: "so the only way to stop the chaos is with more chaos?"

Aquelon: "your plan is in a death spiral?"

"I was going to say what if we introduced something where I became the goddess of dreams or something, but god, imagine explaining that to someone who's binging the series and then outta nowhere 'oh hey everything is different'"

Wonder: "yeah, and you said so yourself: you're not a goddess"

Brush: "that sure would be a choice!"

Wonder: "and you can't really lie now, can you?"

Prince: "!ThrowAWrenchInPrism'sSchemes"

Aquelon: "yeah that would be wildly unfair.  i have a friend who can't be here tonight."

Greenshi: "No worse then the rest of your writing"

Epicsuperbat: “Can we slap you again?”

"Yeah....I guess it would just be better if we just sort of retconned this whole last part with TOJ and me coming in. That way we can keep the rising conflict going....after all, we're nearing the halfway point of the tournament, if we want the narrative climax to align with the tourney's climax, resetting at this point would be disastrous...."

"Granted, I should make something clear."

Brush: "we still remember :relieved:"

Aquelon: "ehhhh, 'retconned' is a strong word for something already not canon"

"To you all :)"

Wonder: "yeah, but how are you gonna explain the black eye? :)"

"My favorite little critics <3"

Prince: "We'll still remember! :)"

Epicsuperbat: “I still want to slap you”

Insider2000: "<3"

J0rt: "fuck you <3"

Greenshi: "Fucker"

Brush: "<3<"

Prince: "And you know what they say about critics."

"I'm well aware that you'll still remember! :)"

Prince: "...wait what do they say about critics"

J0rt: "everyone is one?"

Epicsuperbat: “Can we slap you now?”

Brush: "they're just like us!"

Aquelon: "you're your own worst critic?"

Aubz: “I don’t like you very much.”

Greenshi: "Who needs em? We all have em!"

Brush: "a critic a day keeps the babysitter away"

Prince: "exactly that"

Insider2000: "Too bad you can't make us forget."

Wonder: "yeah, i guess it applies to prism because she can't understand when her writing is bad"

"And I intend to keep the black eye....not like I had any choice, but even so. I think that you all deserve SOME catharsis. Consider it a kindness from me to you that I wouldn't remove it even if I could :)"

Wonder: "fuck's sake, get someone to beta your material"

Aquelon: "keep telling yourself that"

Epicsuperbat: “Hey Jack i assume you can still hear us, slap prism for us please”

Greenshi: "<3 enjoy our present"

Wonder: "maybe then it wouldn't be as half-assed and sloppy"

Brush: "hey does prism have a black eye in the not-dream"

Aquelon: "oooooh good question"

Insider2000: "Probably."

Wonder: "i hope so"

mums: "hey i was gone for a while was there ever indication i could get those potatoes prism"

"Do better at capitalizing first :)"

Brush: "nO,"

Wonder: "i don't need to. it's a discord chat, not actual writing"

"Anyway, like I was saying!"

Brush: "i THINK, i WILL JUST START DOING HOMESTUCK ROLEPLAY,,"

Greenshi: ''fUcK yOu''

Aquelon: "ohhh punctuation and grammar is the most important thing ohhhh look at me,"

mums: "Please do not rp tavros im begging you"

Prince: "this will throw her off"

Epicsuperbat: “Hey Jack, can you slap her some more please”

Wonder: "oooh~, i'm so wounded.... i'm casual with my typing.... OH WOE IS ME!!!!!"

Brush: "throw her off her rhythm. street smarts!"

mums: "Hey Prism! There's something you should know so I'm gonna tell you so!"

Prince: "Don't sweat it!!!"

Aquelon: "Forget it!"

Brush: "enjoy the show!"

"I will leave you all with the nice warm ending that you all had before our rude friend interrupted it. I will still have that black eye (I care about you all <3), and we will continue along and see how it goes!"

J0rt: "ENJOY THE SHOW!"

"Any questions?"

Aubz: "Do you know Candice?"

mums: "nah im good"

Brush: "have you ever played deltarune"

Wonder: "yeah, has peppermint ever sneezed?"

Greenshi: "Yeah: why are you like this?"

mums: "Hows spectrum doing? life wise?"

Epicsuperbat: “Can you let Jack draw on your face”

Aquelon: "hey what's the name of that one assist fighter that's made up of pink orbs?"

[replying to "Do you know Candice?"]

"As a matter of fact, yes! I met her on a Sugondese Expedition!"

Greenshi: "Also, why Shadow? Why do this to him?"

Aubz: GOD

Aubz: DAMN IT

Aquelon: "SUGONDESE NUTS"

Epicsuperbat: “Also, is peppermint into women?”

Prince: "Hey who's this"

[replying to "yeah, has peppermint ever sneezed?"]

"I know the answer to that question :)"

Brush: "bofa deez nuts"

Wonder: "well?"

Prince: "seriously he's inside my house i can't get im out"

Aquelon: "question deez nuts"

[replying to "Yeah: why are you like this?"]

"Scroll up to the last few hundred messages :)"

Greenshi: "No"

J0rt: "that's not an answer. That's the reason for the question"

[replying to "have you ever played deltarune"]

"Depends on how deep into the metaphor we are! For the sake of answering, yes! :)"

mums: "WEAIT PRISM. What do you know of blasp. yeah i know this isnt gonna work. But gotta try right?"

Brush: "aight cool just wanted to know :)"

[replying to "WEAIT PRISM. What do you know of blasp. yeah i know this isnt gonna work. But gotta try right?"]

"And your perseverance is admirable!!"

mums: "Thank u :)"

Brush: "our pet theories will only ever be teased at :relieved:"

Brush: "Palutena."

mums: "I live with that just fine"

Epicsuperbat: “Is the earth flat”

[replying to “Also, is peppermint into women?”]

"If you're interested in dating someone who isn't real, why are you letting me get in the way? :)"

Epicsuperbat: “Good point”

[replying to "Hey who's this"]

Susan K. Pawn!

Brush: "you can date whoever you want in your dreams"

Wonder: "lot of these answers are pretty non-committal"

Epicsuperbat: “I’m gonna beat you up in my imagination now”

Insider2000: "I know who can stop you, Prism: Seachu!"

[replying to "Hows spectrum doing? life wise?"]

"Once again, that depends on what level of the metaphor we're working with today! And honestly, can you imagine keeping it consistent? He can't even keep the name of a bird consistent :)"

Wonder: "at least he keeps characters consistent"

Brush: "well......"

Wonder: "most of the time"

"Yes, consistent characters like Korioni"

Epicsuperbat: “I assumed there was more than one bird” “Icee seems like the type”

Insider2000: "You certainly like to mock the very person who made you."

Wonder: "and yet somehow, korioni has been more consistent than any of your edits"

Brush: "icee having a whole murder of crows is metal as fuck"

Prince: "icee murders people with a bunch of crows"

Insider2000: "If anyone could make you cease to be... It'd be him."

Aquelon: "korioni's had 3 VAs, and also got a canon explanation for that in being a hydra.  There Was An Effort, hey!"

"What can I say, the whole Iggylocke Incident rubbed off on him!"

Aquelon: "might've been 2 vas.  still."

Brush: "he makes an effort, anyhow!"

Brush: "exceptions are exceptions"

Epicsuperbat: “Ryan’s still a better writer than you will ever be”

Aquelon: "by definition!"

chirp: "listen, consistency isnt the name of the game here and it never was! This is an improv medium!"

Wonder: "_peppermint_ can write better. and canonically, we haven't seen her write yet!"

Brush: "as long as they're consistent from moment to moment!"

Prince: "improv my beloved :)"

Aquelon: "tis the difference between improvising and discarding"

Brush: "it's all about the Yes And, not No :)"

Aquelon: "in which we come to the other thing: this is an improv medium.  the inconsistencies that aren't yours are a product of improv.  yknow what else is a product of improv?  spaghebbi."

"Either way, I've appreciated this little Q&A we've done here. And as fun as this thought experiment is, this meta fun time isn't what we're here for! If Ryan wants to speak candidly about how he feels about his creation process, he can take it to a chat! But this domain is the story! So let's get back to that!"

Aquelon: "it's a foiling, of sorts, is what i'm saying"

Aquelon: "yeah that's fair.  anyway susan coupon deez nuts"

Brush: "yeah let's get back to yelling and biting and maiming"

Prince: "susan coupon deez nuts!"

"Maybe we'll have another time to talk like this, but until then, remember that I love you guys <3"

Epicsuperbat: “Let jack write on your face!”

Prince: "Wait it was Susan K. Pawn"

Wonder: "fuck off and die <3"

Aquelon: "get hit with a-"

Prince: "Like you are-"
