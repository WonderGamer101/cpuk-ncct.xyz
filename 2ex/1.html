            Dani looks down at the slip of paper. She&#39;s starting to feel the bags under her eyes as the url burned into her skull. &quot;<a href="https://challonge.com/DreamKerfuffle2">http://challonge.com/DreamKerfuffle2</a> &quot;..... what in the hell does it mean. She pulled out her phone and entered the url again. The page ended up loading <span class="prism">absolutely nothing :)</span>! What the hell did it mean? And what was Prism doing in her dreams? Would it even be a good idea to sleep?

        <p class="ryan text"><s>accidentally funny meta moment</s></p>

        <p class="text">
            &quot;DANTOINETTE!&quot; came a sudden shout so loud, it felt like a light turned on in her brain. <span class="prism">I just think all this clicking is tedious :)</span> <span class="note">[note: all dialogue up to this point was contained in spoiler tags]</span> Well, at least sleep isn&#39;t going to take her slowly with Captain Quadratic entering the room. &quot;DID YOU FEEL THAT JUST NOW?&quot;
        </p>
        <p class="text">Dani shakes her head, covering one of her ears instinctively,</p>
        <p class="text">&quot;Feel what? The onset of tinnitus?&quot;</p>
        <p class="text">
            &quot;SOMETHING ARGUABLY WORSE DEPENDING UPON YOUR PRIORITIES! PRISMS POWER IS CURRENTLY AT WORK! AND I BELIEVE IT IS RELATED TO THE PIECE OF PAPER YOU HAVE RECEIVED!&quot;
        </p>
        <p class="text">She tenses slightly at hearing her suspicions confirmed.</p>
        <p class="text">
            &quot;SO what, is she sleeptalking? Or....I guess...sleep... Prisming? Whatever the hell she does with her creepy reality bending bullshit?&quot;
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            The green-clad captain gives Prism an intense stare, as if scanning her. "I DO NOT KNOW FOR CERTAIN! JUDGING BY WHAT I KNOW OF PRISMS POWERS, PERHAPS IT IS SOME SORT OF STRANGE ABSTRACT METAPHOR FOR THE SERIES! REGARDLESS I FIND THAT SOMETHING SUCH AS THAT IS MOSTLY SEMANTICS!"
        </p>
        <p class="text">"Metaphor for the wh-"</p>
        <p class="text">"I WILL EXPLAIN LATER! FOR NOW IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE PLAY ALONG WITH HER GAME AND TAKE ANOTHER NAP!"</p>
        <p class="text">
            She rubs her eyes groggily. She hasn't slept in....however long it's been. "I mean, do we have to? Can't we just..." she pulls out her axe, glancing between it, Quadratic, and the sleeping Prism "...find <em>another</em> way to wake her up?"
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Quad puts out his hand to stop his friend. "NO! I UNDERSTAND YOUR WISH TO BEAT HE SENSELESS. AND I WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT AS WELL! BUT THIS IS SOMETHING OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL! WE MUST PLAY INTO HER GAME HERE WHETHER WE WANT TO OR NOT!" While his voice rarely changed tones, his single volume setting speaks in less of a commanding tone and more of a matter-of-fact one.
        </p>
        <p class="text"><span class="prism">Dani sighs, putting her axe away. "Okay, fine. Whatever. You're the one who knows so much about this Prism junk. So what's the plan?" :)</span></p>
        <p class="text">
            Quadratic's eyes narrow. "LIKE I SAID....WE CAN'T LAY A FINGER ON HER....WHETHER WE WANT TO OR NOT... EITHER WAY, I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT EVEN THOUGH I AM BUILT TO RESIST PRISM'S DRAW AND CAN SENSE WHEN SHE IS USING HER POWER, I AM FAR FROM THE BEST PERSON TO HELP US DEAL WITH THIS! SO I HAVE DECIDED TO BRING HIM UP TO SEE IF HE CAN GIVE US SOME ADVICE GOING INTO THIS SCENARIO! AND ALSO TO KEEP AN EYE ON THINGS WHILE THE TWO OF US ARE ASLEEP"
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            And in from the doorway comes a man with a cold demeanor, with his blue headband sporting a strange insignia. He saunters in, letting the many voices ringing in his head reach a sort of harmony. Discord Jack nods to the two of them, but says nothing yet.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Quadratic nods back politely. "I WAS HAVING A DISCUSSION WITH DISCORD JACK, AND IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE PEOPLE HE IS CONNECTED TO ARE FAR MORE AWARE OF PRISM'S POWER THAN EVEN I AM! THEY SEEM TO KNOW ALL THERE IS TO KNOW!!"
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Dantoinette slumps down in the chair putting one leg over the armrest, looking up to Discord Jack. "Alright, Jack. What do you think we should do? Talk to me."
        </p>
        <p class="text">"...why isn't he saying anything?"</p>
        <p class="text">"PERHAPS THERE IS A WAY THAT SPEECH CAN BE MORE DIRECT"</p>
        <p class="text">"More direct? Like what?"</p>
        <p class="text">"I DO NOT KNOW! PERHAPS IT MUST BE MARKED IN SOME WAY?"</p>
